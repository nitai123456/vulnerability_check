a simple python program that hopes to streamline
the process of vulnerability checking on hosts in the
same subnet.<br>
the project aims to allow security analysts focus only on defining
the network and the security level they want to inforce

## Usage


## Future
1. make Vulnerabilities in the /vulnerabilities tab class with
more helper functions
2. define common element better, such that common would include
types and models that could appear in other vulnerabilities and there checks
3. encapsulate the client and sudo to better streamline sending and receiving
commands from hosts. 
4. add configuration to vulnerabilities to allow for prioritizing
